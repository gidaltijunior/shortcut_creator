# Example of how to use it:

For this example, we will create a shortcut for the shortcut_creator itself!

First, run the shortcut_creator as you would do with any python script:
```
python3 shortcutcreator.py
```
or by giving it execution privileges and double clicking the .py file.

Fill the fields like this:<br>

After clicking on "Create" button, a ".desktop" file is created containing the following:<br>

The shortcut then will be available in the application drawer:<br>
